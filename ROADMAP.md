# MTP-DB Roadmap

This file aggregates all the main milestones for the project as a sort-of-ordered roadmap:

- [Release the database](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/MTP-DB/issues/29): The database should be released to the public, in theory with an associated pre-print;
- [Test the database](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/MTP-DB/issues/30): The database has little to no testing. We should add automated test to check for the ability of Daedalus to run, as well as the correctness of the result.
- [Make a non-CLI interface](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/MTP-DB/issues/31): The database could use a GUI to be accessed by non-informatics-savvy people.
